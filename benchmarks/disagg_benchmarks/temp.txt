These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
When I behold the violet past prime,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
How can I then be elder than thou art?
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
But that thou none lovest is most evident;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
Or any of these all, or all, or more,

All losses are restored and sorrows end.
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,

For thee and for myself no quiet find.

To witness duty, not to show my wit:
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
Who will believe my verse in time to come,
O, let my books be then the eloquence
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!

And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a famine where abundance lies,

Save that my soul's imaginary sight

And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,

Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?

Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er

So long as youth and thou are of one date;
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
