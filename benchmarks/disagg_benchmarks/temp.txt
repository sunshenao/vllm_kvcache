These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
When I behold the violet past prime,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
How can I then be elder than thou art?
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
But that thou none lovest is most evident;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
Or any of these all, or all, or more,
All losses are restored and sorrows end.
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
For thee and for myself no quiet find.
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
To witness duty, not to show my wit:
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
Who will believe my verse in time to come,
O, let my books be then the eloquence
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
After a thousand victories once foil'd,

And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
That on himself such murderous shame commits.
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
And die as fast as they see others grow;
Him in thy course untainted do allow
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
As an unperfect actor on the stage
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Then look I death my days should expiate.
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:
Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.
From his low tract and look another way:
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
And being frank she lends to those are free.
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,

Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,

But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:

Die single, and thine image dies with thee.

So long lives this and this gives life to thee.

And that unfair which fairly doth excel:

For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.

To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:

But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
And by addition me of thee defeated,

Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,

And kept unused, the user so destroys it.

And summer's lease hath all too short a date:

Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.

Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
For never-resting time leads summer on
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
For having traffic with thyself alone,
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
But since he died and poets better prove,
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
Let those who are in favour with their stars

And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds

To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
His tender heir might bear his memory:
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
And perspective it is the painter's art.
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
I all alone beweep my outcast state
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
And trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
Or any of these all, or all, or more,
To hideous winter and confounds him there;
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
If all were minded so, the times should cease
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
As an unperfect actor on the stage
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,

And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
And for a woman wert thou first created;
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
And for a woman wert thou first created;
And fortify yourself in your decay
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
And all in war with Time for love of you,
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
And, constant stars, in them I read such art
And perspective it is the painter's art.
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
When I consider every thing that grows
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
After a thousand victories once foil'd,
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
This were to be new made when thou art old,
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;

Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;

Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,

But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,

Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
And all those friends which I thought buried.
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
Leaving thee living in posterity?
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
You had a father: let your son say so.
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,
That due of many now is thine alone:
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
I make my love engrafted to this store:
But since he died and poets better prove,
For never-resting time leads summer on
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,
This were to be new made when thou art old,
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Their images I loved I view in thee,
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:

Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;

And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:

Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?

Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!

In our two loves there is but one respect,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;

Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;

And threescore year would make the world away.

And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,

And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
And fortify yourself in your decay
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.

By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
But do not so; I love thee in such sort
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'
My love shall in my verse ever live young.
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
If thou survive my well-contented day,
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Him in thy course untainted do allow
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
As interest of the dead, which now appear
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?

And being frank she lends to those are free.
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
For thee and for myself no quiet find.
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
Who will believe my verse in time to come,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
And trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
For never-resting time leads summer on
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.
As interest of the dead, which now appear
So is it not with me as with that Muse
Yourself again after yourself's decease,
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
But since he died and poets better prove,
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
And by a part of all thy glory live.
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
And many maiden gardens yet unset
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
So long as youth and thou are of one date;
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;

To march in ranks of better equipage:
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
But then begins a journey in my head,
And by a part of all thy glory live.
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
Make thee another self, for love of me,
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!Exceeded by the height of happier men.
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
Or any of these all, or all, or more,
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
For at a frown they in their glory die.
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
So shall those blots that do with me remain
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
O, let my books be then the eloquence
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
Will play the tyrants to the very same
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
My love shall in my verse ever live young.
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
So should my papers yellow'd with their age
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,

Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
No love toward others in that bosom sits
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Their images I loved I view in thee,
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Make thee another self, for love of me,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
But then begins a journey in my head,
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
As an unperfect actor on the stage
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
How can I then be elder than thou art?
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
When every private widow well may keep
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,

For no man well of such a salve can speak
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
Making a famine where abundance lies,
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
And all in war with Time for love of you,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
Now is the time that face should form another;
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
That thou consumest thyself in single life?
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
That use is not forbidden usury,
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
How many a holy and obsequious tear
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
That I an accessary needs must be
That on himself such murderous shame commits.
And then believe me, my love is as fair
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
I make my love engrafted to this store:
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
The one by toil, the other to complain
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Compare them with the bettering of the time,

Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
Then, were not summer's distillation left,
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,

Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
Or any of these all, or all, or more,
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright
So should my papers yellow'd with their age
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
No love toward others in that bosom sits
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
So should my papers yellow'd with their age

And trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
After a thousand victories once foil'd,

But that I hope some good conceit of thine
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,

Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
When I consider every thing that grows
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
Where I may not remove nor be removed.
And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
My love shall in my verse ever live young.

Like to the lark at break of day arising
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
And stretched metre of an antique song:
Let those who are in favour with their stars
This were to be new made when thou art old,
For thee and for myself no quiet find.
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.

Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,

Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
From his low tract and look another way:
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
How can I then be elder than thou art?
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
And for a woman wert thou first created;
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
O, let my books be then the eloquence
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;

Such civil war is in my love and hate
To march in ranks of better equipage:
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Leaving thee living in posterity?
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
Leaving thee living in posterity?
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
If thou survive my well-contented day,
